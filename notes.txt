Okay so first we need a way to read the Kenken. Could try to learn image recognition,
or could create an interface for someone to do it.

Create n ** 2 classes, where n is the Kenken size. Each one is a single cell,
with a "possible numbers" array, from 0 to n-1. Each is set equal to 1 by default.
When a number is confirmed to not be possible, we set it to 0. When only one number
is possible, we set the actual variable to be equal to that number.
So, variables are: actual (single num), possible (array), formula (x9 or +12 or w/e)

Create x classes for each set of blocks. Variables are an array of blocks inside
of it, and the formula.

Go through, put in any actuals we can.

Then, find way to create actuals. Have each block look at what blocks in the same set
but different row/column are doing. If they can't have a certain number then maybe
the looking block has to be that number, e.g.

Once we've logicked as much as we can, we can start random guessing.
